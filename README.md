# Lazy-Susan-Mobile-App
This is a repository for my first mobile app.  The premise behind the app is pretty simple: allow the user to input various spices that they can later pull up when they are unsure whether to purchase more or not.  Currently, I see the app as needing a means of taking inputs and storing them into a database, a means to pull up said inputs, and a wheel UI to emulate the use of a Lazy Susan.  

Since I am unsure what all of this will involve (as I have never done anything remotely like this before), my timeline is very fuzzy at the moment.  Once I get a better handle on things, I will update this readme with dates for when I will get various aspects and features completed.

Thanks!
